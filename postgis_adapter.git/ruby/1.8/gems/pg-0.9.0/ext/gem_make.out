checking for pg_config... no

  ===========   WARNING   ===========
  
  You are building this extension on OS X without setting the 
  ARCHFLAGS environment variable, and pg_config wasn't found in 
  your PATH. If you are seeing this message, that means that the 
  build will probably fail.

  If it does, you can correct this by either including the path 
  to 'pg_config' in your PATH or setting the environment variable 
  ARCHFLAGS to '-arch <arch>' before building.

  For example:
  (in bash) $ export PATH=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin:$PATH                  
            $ export ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
  (in tcsh) % set path = ( /opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin $PATH )
            % setenv ARCHFLAGS '-arch x86_64'

  Then try building again.
